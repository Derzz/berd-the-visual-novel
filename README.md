# berd the visual novel

berd the visual novel is a small game I made using the Ren'py Visual Novel Engine and various assets from berd([Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRei8TBpt4r0WPZ7MkiKmVg))

This project was made for fun and is me being silly while learning the Ren'py Engine.

This project also utilises Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Music, specifically from the Ace Attorney Meets Orchestra and Phoenix Wright Special Courtroom 2008 Orchestra Concert albums, and various berd models that were edited in Sketchbook. This project was not made for commercial use so I believe the use of these songs are fine. If there are any issues with the use of specific assets in this game, please let me know.
